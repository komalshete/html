        Workshop participants singled out better support 
        for threading for 3D rendering and advanced audio 
        processing as a core need to run AAA content on the Web. 
        They also discussed proposals to improve support for 
        cloud gaming scenarios, including proposals to reduce
         I/O latency and improve communication in real-time between 
         clients and servers. Technical updates that would benefit 
         the Web games ecosystem as a whole were identified and 
         the workshop proved very useful to run broader discussions 
         on discoverability, monetization, hosted Web runtimes and
          accessibility. These discussions may warrant the creation
           of a games activity at W3C to coordinate inputs from 
           the games community, pursue broader discussions, 
        and track progress on needs identified during the workshop.
