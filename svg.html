Differences Between SVG and Canvas
SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML.

Canvas draws 2D graphics, on the fly (with a JavaScript).

SVG is XML based, which means that every element is 
available within the SVG DOM. 
You can attach JavaScript event handlers for an element.

In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object. 
If attributes of an SVG object are changed,
 the browser can automatically re-render the shape.

Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel. 

In canvas, once the graphic is drawn, it is forgotten by 
the browser. 
If its position should be changed, the entire scene needs to be 
redrawn, including any objects that might have been covered by 
the graphic.




Canvas	
Resolution dependent
No support for event handlers
Poor text rendering capabilities
You can save the resulting image as .png or .jpg
Well suited for graphic-intensive games

SVG
Resolution independent
Support for event handlers
Best suited for applications with large rendering areas (Google Maps)
Slow rendering if complex (anything that uses the DOM a lot will be slow)
Not suited for game applications
